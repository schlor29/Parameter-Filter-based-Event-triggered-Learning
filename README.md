# Parameter-Filter-based-Event-triggered-Learning

This repository contains the code for the paper "Parameter Filter-based Event-triggered Learning" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02059).

The 'figures' folder contains the data and figures used in the paper for the different update strategies.

The simulations were performed using the file 'simulateKFTriggerPlot.m'.
All other files are auxiliary files for the simulation.
The folder 'MTP' contains some useful external toolboxes.
